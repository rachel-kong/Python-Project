# Python-Project
This is my Python Jupyter Mini Project for CS102 Fall 2021




The Python python is about the greenhouse gas emissions by region in Australia. 

First, the libraries were imported. These include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and matplotlib.pyplot. Next, the data frame was set up so that pandas can read the csv file. Region was defined and all the unique regions were listed in an array. Then, 3 regions were defined: Auckland, Bay of Plenty, and Canterbury. The first 3 greenhouse gas emissions values, rounded to the nearest whole number, were used. After that, the graph elements were set up. Unfortunately, the code does not work.
